# LaaS Evaluation Software
This project includes 2 user study phases:
- Study 1: User Performance Study (welcome.html)
- Study 2: Perceived Quality Evaluation (welcome_s2.html)

## Installation
```python
git clone https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io.git
```

## Dataset
Study 1 and Study 2 utilize the same testing dataset, which is stored in [/dataset_png](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/tree/master/dataset_png) and managed by .json file.

### .json (.js) file for dataset management
**Tree 1.** Description of the structure for dataset management .json file
```
|--"id"
|--"variants"
  |-- C0
    |--"condition": 0
    |--"img_id"
    |--"ioi_id"
    |--"coords"
  |--C1
    ...
  |--C2
    ...
  |--C3
    ...
...
```
  
**Table 1.** Description of dataset management .json file
|Key  |Description            |Exemple  |
|:-   |:-                     |:-
|id   |The id of the selected webpage |"1-yle"  |
|variants |Wrapping the 4 design variants for the selected webpage|  |
|condition  |The condition of design variants: 0, 1, 2, 3 stand for original, selection time, saliency, combination |"C0" |
|img_id |The id of the design variant image |"1-yle_0"  |
|ioi_id |The id of the item of interest for this design variant |"1-yle_0"  |
|coord  |The coordinate of the item of interest on the design variant image |"77,2562,525,3121" |

*NB:* 
- Since itâ€™s a bit of hassle to read local json file, here we use the .js file ([data.js](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/blob/master/js/data.js)) to contain the json file
- The coords of IOI is obtained manually by this [tool](https://www.image-map.net/)

### Image folder for the dataset
**Tree 1.** Description of the structure for dataset image folder
```
|-- dataset_png
  |-- id
    |--image of design variant 0 (img_id_0.png)
    |--image of the IOI of design variant 0 (img_id_0_i.png)
    |--image of design variant 1 (img_id_1.png)
    |--image of the IOI of design variant 1 (img_id_1_i.png)
    |--image of design variant 2 (img_id_2.png)
    |--image of the IOI of design variant 2 (img_id_2_i.png)
    |--image of design variant 3 (img_id_3.png)
    |--image of the IOI of design variant 3 (img_id_3_i.png)
  ...
  |-- testing data
```

*NB:* 
- For each selected website, the images for 4 design variants and 4 cooresponding IOI are put under the same folder, which is named by the id of this website.
- For clearer demonstration, 4 design variants for one selected website are marked with C0/C1/C2/C3 on the top-left corner of each image.
- The [/testing data](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/tree/master/dataset_png/testing%20data) folder and [testdata.js](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/blob/master/js/testdata.js) contain the data for the testing phase of Study 1. Please **Do Not REMOVE THEM**.

## Process of the user study
### Study 1 
[Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFqTButZFzcvyVd8wyzVeT-1x_x68FnQ/view?usp=sharing) for Study 1

[Try it out](https://anqi188.github.io/welcome.html)

- Testing phase: 3 trials for participants to get to know how it works and stablize their performance. These 3 trials will **not** be logged into the result.
- Formal study phase: Consisting of 3 rounds of trials, the participant will interact with the entire subdataset in each round, and repeat the study 3 times altogether.
- The study result needs to be downloaded by the participant, and send to the contact person.
- For the detailed instruction, please see in [welcome.html](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/blob/master/welcome.html)
### Study 2
[Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dW0QNpL1puop0k9VBWqko8_ejKVGcp2/view?usp=sharing) for Study 2

[Try it out](https://anqi188.github.io/welcome_s2.html)

- Inspecting and grading 4 design variants in each trial.
- The study result needs to be downloaded by the participant, and send to the contact person.
- For the detailed instruction, please see in [welcome_s2.html](https://github.com/anqi188/anqi188.github.io/blob/master/welcome_s2.html)
